# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4, where we learn how to create robots that can understand and respond to natural human commands.

## Overview

This module covers:
- Vision-Language-Action models for robotics
- Natural language understanding in robotics
- Action planning from human commands
- Multimodal perception systems

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
1. How VLA models enable natural human-robot interaction
2. Best practices for multimodal perception
3. How to implement action planning from language
4. Advanced techniques for embodied AI systems
