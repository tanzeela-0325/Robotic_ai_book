# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1, where we explore the foundational architecture that connects all robot components through the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2).

## Overview

This module covers:
- ROS 2 architecture fundamentals
- Node communication patterns
- Message passing systems
- Service and action implementations

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
1. How ROS 2 enables distributed robotics systems
2. Best practices for node design and communication
3. How to implement robust message passing
4. Advanced ROS 2 features for humanoid robotics
