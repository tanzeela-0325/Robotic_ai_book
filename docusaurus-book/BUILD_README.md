how GitHub Pages serves the content. This does not affect the actual functionality.

## Access the Site

## Troubleshooting
If you see the "Your Docusaurus site did not load properly" banner:
1. Clear your browser cache completely
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
3. Try accessing in an incognito/private browser window
4. Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to fully update

## Configuration
The build uses the following key configuration:
- baseUrl: '/Robotic_ai_book/'
- trailingSlash: false
- onBrokenLinks: 'warn'
- onBrokenMarkdownLinks: 'warn'

All documentation links are properly configured to use the correct base path.
